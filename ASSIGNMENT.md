# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned the API by reading the README and also thinking through the code line by line. The part that made sense right away was the destination filtering but one thing I struggled with for awhile was the numbers that were assigned to each city. After adding my own cities and changing the numbers I realized that they served as an ID for each city.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> I would say that good abstract comments describe what the method/function is doing at a high level not HOW (line by line descriptions). It should be able to be understood by someone who does not know code.

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 2 hours


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Yes, Kevin Ly recommended the library but I learned it on my own. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> No problems.
